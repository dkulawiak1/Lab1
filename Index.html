		<p> Hey Professor, great to be in your class again! My name is Daniel Kulawiak I am 
		a junior this year, and ready to learn more about website design. This took me a little bit 
		of time to refresh my html skills, but I think I am back in the groove. Can't wait to see what 
		this class has in store for me!</p>
